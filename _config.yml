story: |
  Hi, [I'm Andr√©](https://devpg.com). I've started my tech career more than 15 years ago. In my role as a technical leader I've been always facing challenging situations. My main strategy to handle these is to constantly learn.
  
  Over the years I built up a collection of articles, slides, talks, etc ... and I will continue do so. I'm happy to share it with other technical leaders who seek for experience sharing to derive learnings and take the right decisions.
