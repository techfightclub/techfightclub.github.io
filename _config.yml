story: |
  Hi, [I'm Andr√©](https://devpg.com). I've started my tech career more than 15 years ago. In my role as a technical leader I've been always facing challenging situations. My main strategy to handle these is to constantly learn.
  
  Over the recent years I have been building up a collection of articles, slides, talks, etc ... and I will continue to do so. This page serves as a public repository so other technical leaders who seek for experience can derive learnings and take the right decisions.
